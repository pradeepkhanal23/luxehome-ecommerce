## Technologies Used

The LuxeHome Ecommerce website utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: The project is built using the React JavaScript library, which provides a powerful and efficient framework for building user interfaces.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and responsive UI development. It offers a wide range of pre-defined utility classes to style components effectively.

- **Vite**: Vite is a fast and lightweight development tool that enhances the development experience. It offers rapid bundling and hot module replacement, allowing for quick iteration and faster build times.

- **Context API**: The Context API is a feature of React that enables efficient state management and sharing of data between components. It is used in this project to manage and pass data related to user preferences, shopping cart, and other global application state.

- **Axios**: Axios is a JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js. It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling asynchronous requests and responses. In this project, Axios is used for fetching data from external APIs, such as retrieving product information from the John Smilga React Course API.

## Project Inspiration

The idea for the LuxeHome Furniture project originated from John Smilga's React course, which provided invaluable insights and guidance on building robust and feature-rich ecommerce websites using React. LuxeHome Furniture utilizes an API provided by the John Smilga React course to fetch product data, ensuring a realistic and comprehensive showcase of furniture items

## Features

- **Sorting Capabilities**: Users can sort furniture products based on various attributes, such as price, name. Sorting options include sorting by price from high to low or low to high, as well as sorting by name from A to Z or Z to A.

- **User Authentication**: The website incorporates user authentication, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and personalize their shopping experience.
